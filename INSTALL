Installation Instructions
=========================

This file contains instructions for building and installing IPO from
source on Linux. The process on Windows is similar.


Dependency: scipoptsuite >= 3.2.0
=================================

Alternative A: Install ZIMPL, SoPlex and SCIP to some folder, e.g., /usr/local/:

1. After unpacking the SCIP tarball, unpack its subprojects:

   $ cd scipoptsuite-*/
   $ make

2. Compile and install ZIMPL:

   $ cd zimpl-*/
   $ make OPT=dbg
   $ make OPT=opt
   $ sudo cp lib/* /usr/local/lib/
   $ cd ..

3. Compile and install SoPlex:

   $ cd soplex-*/
   $ make INSTALLDIR=/usr/local/ OPT=dbg
   $ sudo make INSTALLDIR=/usr/local/ OPT=dbg install
   $ make INSTALLDIR=/usr/local/ OPT=opt
   $ sudo make INSTALLDIR=/usr/local/ OPT=opt install
   $ cd src/
   $ sudo cp timerfactory.h notimer.h usertimer.h wallclocktimer.h /usr/local/include/
   $ sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/include/*timer*.h
   $ cd ../..

3. Compile and install SCIP:

   $ cd scip-*/
   $ make INSTALLDIR=/usr/local/ OPT=dbg LPS=spx2 LPSOPT=dbg
   $ sudo make INSTALLDIR=/usr/local/ OPT=dbg LPS=spx2 LPSOPT=dbg install
   $ cd src/scip
   $ sudo cp implics.h history.h set.h message.h tree.h misc.h var.h event.h /usr/local/include/scip/
   $ sudo chmod a+r -R /usr/local/include/scip/

4. If you already have SCIP installed, note that IPO needs certain header files
   (see `cp` command above).

5. Subsequently, by ${ZIMPL}, ${SoPlex} and ${SCIP} this manual refers to the installation path, e.g., /usr/local/



Alternative B: Just compile ZIMPL, SoPlex and SCIP:

1. After unpacking the SCIP tarball, unpack its subprojects:

   $ cd scipoptsuite-*/
   $ make

2. Compile ZIMPL:

   $ cd zimpl-*/
   $ make OPT=opt
   $ cd ..

3. Compile SoPlex:

   $ cd soplex-*/
   $ make OPT=opt
   $ cd ..

3. Compile SCIP:

   $ cd scip-*/
   $ make OPT=opt LPS=spx2 LPSOPT=opt

4. Subsequently, by ${ZIMPL}, ${SoPlex} and ${SCIP} this manual refers to the 
   respective paths in scipoptsuite-*.


Installing IPO
==============

In order to install IPO from the extracted source tarball you have to
issue the following commands:

1. Step into the root of the source directory.

  $ cd ipo-x.y.z

2. Create a build subdirectory and step into it.

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build

3. Perform system checks and create the makefiles.
   Note that it must be `SoPlex` and not `SOPLEX`!

  $ cmake -DBUILD_TYPE=Release -DSCIP_DIR=${SCIP} ..

4. Build IPO.

  $ make 

  This command compiles the library into a libipo.a file.
  It also compiles the programs in the 'tools' directory.

5. [Optional] Generate the user documentation.

  $ make html

  The release tarballs already include the documentation.

  Note that for this step you need to have the following tools
  installed: Python, Doxygen, Graphviz, Ghostscript, LaTeX.

6. [Optional] Install IPO

  $ make install

  This command installs IPO under /usr/local (you will need root
  privileges to be able to do that). If you want to install it to
  some other location, then pass the
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=DIRECTORY flag to cmake in Step 3.
  For example:
      
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/username/ipo'

Configure Options and Variables
===============================

In Step 3, you can customize the build process by passing options to CMAKE.

$ cmake [OPTIONS] ..

You find a list of the most useful options below.

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PREFIX

  Set the installation prefix to PREFIX. By default it is /usr/local.

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Release|Debug]

  This sets the compiler options. The choices are the following

  'Release': A strong optimization is turned on (-O3 with gcc). This
    is the default setting and we strongly recommend using this for
    the final compilation.

  'Debug': Optimization is turned off and debug info is added (-O0
    -ggdb with gcc). If is recommended during the development.

-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=path-to-compiler

  Change the compiler to be used.

-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=TRUE

  Build shared library instead of static one. Think twice if you
  really want to use this option.

-DZIMPL_ROOT_DIR=path-to-zimpl

  Uses the given path when searching for the ZIMPL library.

-DSoPlex_ROOT_DIR=path-to-soplex

  Uses the given path when searching for the SoPlex library.
  This could be the source or installation directory.

-DSoPlex_BUILD_TYPE=opt|dbg|prf

  Configures IPO to link to optimized, debug or profiling versions of SoPlex.

-DSCIP_ROOT_DIR=path-to-scip

  Uses the given path when searching for the SCIP libraries.
  This could be the source or installation directory.

-DSCIP_BUILD_TYPE=opt|dbg|prf

  Configures IPO to link to optimized, debug or profiling versions of SCIP.

-DSCIP_LPS=spx|spx2

  Configures IPO to link to the spx or spx2 LP interface of SCIP._

-DSCIP_LPS_OPT=opt|dbg|prf

  Configures IPO to link to the LP interface of SCIP that
  was built for profiling, debugging or optimized.

Makefile Variables
==================

make VERBOSE=1

   This results in a more verbose output by showing the full
   compiler and linker commands.
