\section intro Introduction

<b>IPO</b> stands for <i><b>I</b>nvestigating <b>P</b>olyhedra by <b>O</b>racles.
It is a software library for certain problems in polyhedral combinatorics
such as computing the affine hull, checking adjacency, or computing facets.
In contrast to other tools, it only requires the polyhedra to be given
implicitly by means of so-called optimization oracles. 

<b>
IPO is an open source project.
You are free to use it in your commercial or
non-commercial applications under very permissive
\ref license "license terms".
</b>

The project is maintained by Matthias Walter.
